# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Evil Hangman

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The program will choose a secret word and the player has to guess that word letter by letter. If the player guesses incorrectly, the program will generate a new word for the player to guess.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will generate a random word and the player will have to guess that word. The player would guess a valid letter and then the program would go through that random word except for that letter the player guessed. The program will then generate a new word and the player will have to guess a new valid letter. The program will do the same process but now it will choose a different word without the previous letters the player guessed. 

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not combining 1051's final project with another course's final project.

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

What I will accomplish is the game ending either when the player correctly guesses the word or when the player runs out of their amount of guesses.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

What I think I can accomplish before the final project's deadline is being able to run the program with minor errors or misunderstandings.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

What I hope to accomplish before the final project's deadline is being able to run and play the program as a player, hoping that there are no errors and misunderstandings at all.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will try to get started as soon as possible so that we won't miss the deadline. The skills that we need to acquire is being able visually understand code and being able to keep up with what the program/coding is outputting. Topics that we will need to research are related to hangman like maybe a guideline walking us through on how to program a game of hangman where it is unbeatable. We are not particularly sure who's role is what but so far we are trying to think of a date and time we are available so that we can have three people working on this final project.
